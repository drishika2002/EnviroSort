# EnviroSort
AI-Driven Waste Classifier for Effective Recycling Practices

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive waste classification system for analyzing images or videos to accurately categorize different types of waste. By implementing computer vision techniques, the system aims to automate and optimize waste sorting processes, leading to improved recycling efforts, reduced environmental pollution, and enhanced resource utilization. The project's goal is to provide an intelligent solution that benefits waste management facilities, recycling industries, environmental organizations, and society at large by promoting sustainable practices and minimizing waste mismanagement.
